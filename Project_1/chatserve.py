 Assignment: Project 1
 Filename: chatserve.py
 Description: Design and implement a simple chat system that works for one pair 
    of users, i.e., create two programs: a chat server and a chat client.  The
    final version of your programs must accomplish the following tasks:
        1. chatserve starts on host A. 
        2. chatserve on host A waits on a port (specified by command-line) for 
            a client request. 
        3. chatclient starts on host B, specifying host A's hostname and port 
            number on the command line. 
        4. chatclient on host B gets the user's "handle" by initial query (a 
            one-word name, up to 10 characters).  chatclient will display this 
            handle as a prompt on host B, and will prepend it to all messages 
            sent to host A.  e.g.,  "SteveO> Hi!!" 
        5. chatclient on host B sends an initial message to chatserve on host 
            A : PORTNUM.  This causes a connection to be established between 
            Host A and Host B.  Host A and host B are now peers, and may alternate 
            sending and receiving messages.  Responses from host A should have 
            host Aâ€™s "handle" prepended. 
        6. Host A responds to Host B, or closes the connection with the command "\quit" 
        7. Host B responds to Host A, or closes the connection with the command "\quit" 
        8. If the connection is not closed, repeat from 6. 
        9. If the connection is closed, chatserve repeats from 2 
            (until a SIGINT is received)
